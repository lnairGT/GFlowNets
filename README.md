# GFlowNets -- Experiments with text generation using GFlowNets

This repo contains an exploratory project on the use of GFlowNets for text generation. In this simple case, GFlowNets are used to create strings without any repeating letters, and in some cases strings containing certain specific letters (with higher associated reward). To run the code, use `python train.py`.

## Preliminary Results
These are the loss curves for running the training, with some example generations.
